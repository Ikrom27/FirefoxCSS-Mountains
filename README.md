# FirefoxCSS-Mountains
## Welcome
This is a very simple theme that I use myself and made for my own purposes, you can use it for your own purposes too, I don't claim anything.

I use this theme on both Windows 11 and Monjaro KDE (Linux) operating systems, and it works fine on both.

## Intallation
### Create the chrome
1. Enable userChrome.css support in Fx v69+
2. Open about:config
3. Change toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true
4. Open about:support
5. Click on "Profile Folder" -> "Open Folder"
6. Create a sub-folder named "chrome"

### Installation theme
After that, you need to download the archive by clicking the green Code button, unpack the contents into the chrome folder that we just created, and restart the browser.

## My recommendations
1. Use theme.xpi for Firefox color (extension)
2. Use infinity new tab for home page
3. Configure the toolbar as shown below.
